# TNM089-Image-Fusion-with-Laplacian-Pyramids

This project provides implementations of image fusion using Laplacian pyramids. Image fusion is a technique to combine multiple images into a single, enhanced image to improve visibility, detail, or other visual characteristics. Laplacian pyramids are a multi-resolution representation of an image that allow for seamless blending of images at different scales. This project includes functions for creating Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, as well as two fusion methods based on regional statistics.

# Features:

Generate Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids.  
Perform image fusion using regional statistics.  
Compare fusion methods based on deviations, entropies, and regional energy.  
Reconstruct fused images from Laplacian pyramids.
